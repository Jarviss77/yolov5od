# yolov5od

## Overview

Welcome to the **yolov5od** repository! This project is our 5th semster mini project, aimed at creating an intelligent robot that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Object Detection technologies. The robot is designed to identify and move towards objects in its surroundings based on voice commands.

## Project Description

**yolov5od** leverages state-of-the-art technologies to build a robot with the following capabilities:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables the robot to understand and interpret voice commands.
- **Computer Vision**: Allows the robot to perceive its environment and detect objects using advanced vision techniques.
- **Object Detection**: Employs YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) for real-time object detection to identify and locate objects in the robotâ€™s path.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a robot that can interact with its environment in a meaningful way by combining these cutting-edge technologies. It will be able to:
- Receive and process voice commands.
- Detect and recognize objects in its surroundings.
- Move towards the detected objects based on the voice commands received.

## Features

- **Voice Command Processing**: Interprets spoken commands to guide the robot.
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for fast and accurate object detection.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Moves towards identified objects in response to voice commands.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/captainflatbelly/yolov5od.git
   cd yolov5od
